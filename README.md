# CRAbet
A public guess / poll amongst embedded people on who will be the first to be in trouble for violating the CRA.
Invented ad hoc at [Embedded Recipes](https://embedded-recipes.org/2025/), you can enter your guess and wait to find out.

# The intention

To have a fun way for developers to share their opinion on which industries/verticals/device types/... will be insufficiently prepared for the CRA, and actually called out for it.

# The rules

- add your name and guess to this README file and submit as a PR to this repository.
- submissions will be accepted until December 10, 2027 ;-)
- bonus points if you add a small paragraph or explanation why you picked your specific guess
- duplicate entries are not allowed. Neither for players (one person, one guess), nor for guesses (if somebody else already picked the one you want, sorry)
- the first company which gets fined *AFTER* the CRA is in full effect - read, after December 11, 2027 - for violating the CRA specifically, makes the winning decision. If in doubt, the recorded date of legal decision in court counts. Appeals will not be counted, as we all know those will drag out forever.

**We do not want to shame or punish specific companies, and especially not singular people**
So if you are one of the guessed entries and do not want to be, you can file an issue here and we will remove you.

**Common sense will be applied for accepting guesses, e.g. no harassment, insults, you know the drill. The organizers reserve the right take any action in order to keep this a friendly and fun thing.**

# The price

Each of the organizers will donate a small, symbolic and fun price in the range of 5€/5$/5£. The winner will receive those along with eternal fame and glory.

# List of guesses

- Josef Holzmayr: [IRobot](https://www.irobot.com)
- Anna-Lena Marx: [Vorwerk](https://www.vorwerk.com/) (Thermomix)
- Kieran Bingham: [Tuya](https://tuya.eu/) - Far too many prevalent white labelled devices... Though I could imagine it could be a distributor who actually gets fined for one these.
